#  Movie Explorer Application

A frontend web application that allows users to explore and discover movies using real-time data from an external API.  
This project focuses on API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamic UI rendering.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For structuring the application  
- **CSS3** – For styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For application logic and API handling  
- **TMDB API** – For fetching real-time movie data

##  Features

- Browse popular movies  
- Search movies by title  
- View movie details such as rating, overview, and release date  
- Dynamic rendering of movie cards  
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Process

1. Designed the UI layout using HTML  
2. Styled the application with CSS for responsiveness and clean design  
3. Integrated the TMDB API to fetch movie data  
4. Used asynchronous JavaScript (`fetch`, `async/await`) for API calls  
5. Dynamically displayed movie data on the UI  
6. Handled loading states and basic error scenarios
